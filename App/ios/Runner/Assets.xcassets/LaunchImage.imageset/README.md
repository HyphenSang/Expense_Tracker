# Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

Minimum recommended sizes:
- `LaunchImage.png` (1x): 1242 × 2688 px
- `LaunchImage@2x.png`: 2208 × 2208 px (safe area centered)
- `LaunchImage@3x.png`: 2688 × 2688 px (safe area centered)

Keep file names identical to preserve the asset catalog references.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.
